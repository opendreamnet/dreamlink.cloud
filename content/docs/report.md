Please note that DreamLink is an open-source web application that runs on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), a decentralized network that works similar to Torrent. 

We do not store files, accounts or information about the people involved with the reported content nor can we prevent them from using DreamLink again. Our actions will be limited to blocking access to the content from our gateways:  `dreamlink.cloud`, `fs.dreamlink.cloud` and `odn.pw`.

The content may still be available from other gateways outside of our control, please see the [public gateway checker](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/) for owners of other gateways to contact directly.
